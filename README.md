# SurfaceKeyboardNavigationAndSymbolHelper

This AutoHotKey script was created to enable one-handed access to all cursor navigation keys regardless 
of the state of the Fn lock on Microsoft Surface keyboards. Install AutoHotKey then run this script.

With the script, holding the Apps key (the one just left of the left arrow key) when pressing any of 
the four arrow keys provides access to the other four navigation functions. 
  Apps+Left     Home (sort of like "all the way left on the line")
  Apps+Right    End (sort of like "all the way righton the line")
  Apps+Up       Page Up (sort of like "all lines up on the page")
  Apps+Down     Page Down (sort of like "all lines down on the page")

The Apps key can also be used in combination with some other keys to simply access "special" characters:
  Apps+1			  Types ¡ (underside exclamation point)
  Apps+3			  Types £ (British Pounds Sterling symbol)
  Apps+4	      Types € (Euro symbol) or, when shifted, ¢ (cents symbol)
  Apps+8			  Types • (bullet) or, when shiftedm ° (degrees)
  Apps+Dash			Types – (En Dash) or, when shifted, — (Em Dash)
  Apps+Equals   Types ≠ (not equals) or, when shifted, ≈ (almost equals)
  Apps+R			  Types ® (Registered Trademark symbol)
  Apps+T			  Types ™ (Trademark symbol)
  Apps+P			  Types π (Pi) or, when shifted, Π (capital Greek Pi)
  Apps+S			  Types ℠ (Service Mark)	
  Apps+D			  Types Δ (Greek Delta)	
  Apps+X			  Types × (multiplication symbol)	
  Apps+C			  Types ç (c with a cedilla) or, when shifted, © (copyright symbol)
  Apps+N			  Types ñ (n with a tilde)
  Apps+Comma		Types ≤ (less than or equal to symbol)
  Aps+Period		Types ≥ (greater than or equal to symbol)
  Apps+Question	Types ¿ (upsidedown question mark)

This script was inspired by the original Surface Pro 3 Type Cover, which placed the Fn key between the 
right Alt and the left arrow keys. On that keyboard, using the Fn key with an arrow key resulted on 
"the more exaggerated" version of the arrow key itself. With the Surface Pro 4, Mirosoft moved the Fn 
key to the left side of the keyboard, removing one-handed access.

Inspiration for the special character typing comes from using the Option key on macOS. (Note: the 
symbol/key mapping in this script does not match the symbol map on macOS.

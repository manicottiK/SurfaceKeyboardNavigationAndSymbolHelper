# SurfaceKeyboardNavigationAndSymbolHelper

This AutoHotKey script was created to enable one-handed access to all cursor navigation keys regardless 
of the state of the Fn lock on Microsoft Surface keyboards. Install AutoHotKey then run this script.

With the script, holding the Apps key (the one just left of the left arrow key) when pressing any of 
the four arrow keys provides access to the other four navigation functions. The Apps key can also be 
used in combination with some other keys to simply access symbol characters.

See the Wiki for details of the navigation and symbol characters.

This script was inspired by the original Surface Pro 3 Type Cover, which placed the Fn key between the 
right Alt and the left arrow keys. On that keyboard, using the Fn key with an arrow key resulted on 
"the more exaggerated" version of the arrow key itself. With the Surface Pro 4, Mirosoft moved the Fn 
key to the left side of the keyboard, removing one-handed access.

Inspiration for  symbol character typing comes from macOS, where using the Option key provides similar
access. (Note: the symbol/key mapping in this script does not match the symbol map on macOS.)
